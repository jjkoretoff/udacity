The Power of R
Corey Nissen analyzed tweets 
    real-time analysis and automated
    R package: textcat and algo on n-grams
    10 - 20 tweets for review

AUC, ROC, TPR
ROC is a Receiving Operating Characteristic and is a visual way for inspecting the performance of a binary classifier(0/1)
    rate at which your classifier is making correct predicitons
        True Positives (TP) or FP
        ROC was used in ww2 to detect radar effectiveness
How they work:
    diagonal line = 50% correct
    perfect = TPR of 1 and FPR of 0
AUC = area under the curve
    1 = good
    0 = bad
    scikit-learn calculates roc curve in python

Why R
    leading language for statistics and analysis
    line by line
    easily share work
    package ecosystem
        ggplot2 - graphics package
    active community
    free and open source

RStudio Layout
    IDE
    point and click system
    scripts, consol, env/history

Read and subset data
    in a .R file in the class folder
    set working directory to wherever the data is
        once uploaded - click on data in environment to see the table
    subset and bracket method are both used to subset

R Markdown Documents
    installed knitr
    rmd allows for more than r code and hashtags
    r formatting that lets you format webpages
    more info the the instructor notes
    command + option + i adds chunks
    insert r code, plots, etc
