The Power of R
Corey Nissen analyzed tweets 
    real-time analysis and automated
    R package: textcat and algo on n-grams

AUC, ROC, TPR
ROC is a Receiving Operating Characteristic and is a visual way for inspecting the performance of a binary classifier(0/1)
    rate at which your classifier is making correct predicitons
        True Positives (TP) or FP
        ROC was used in ww2 to detect radar effectiveness
How they work:
    diagonal line = 50% correct
    perfect = TPR of 1 and FPR of 0
AUC = area under the curve
    1 = good
    0 = bad
    scikit-learn calculates roc curve in python
