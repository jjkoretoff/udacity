lesson 1

tracking across files
a good situation for tracking inerrelated files is when you are developing a website and have html and css files that impact the structure of the site\'s code

git commit is a snapshot of a repo at each instance you commit code to the repo

rep is a collection of files that are tracked by git 

a git checkout resets all files to a previous state

using the git commands w/ asteroids repo
  git clone https://github.com/udacity/asteroids.git
  cd asteroids/
  git config --global color.ui auto
  git log = find id that reverted controls
  git diff f19cb1b (previous) b0678b1 (revrt controls) 

solving problem with endless bullets
  git checkout reverted controls
    detached head state - if you make changes then issue
  check index.html... bullets are working
  git log = revert controls to top of list
  git checkout to return to norm state **need last id***

find where error happend

commands:
  git --stat = gives some stats about a commit 
  git clone
  git config
  git log
  git diff
