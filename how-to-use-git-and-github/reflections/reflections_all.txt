Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    the interdependency of a git repo is probobaly greated than that of a google docs doc. each doc in google docs has the interrelated information. however, it can be troublesome when you are linked between mutliple files. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    once i have accessed a git repo by sing git clone and the respective url, i can then take a look at the versions

    git log shows me the history of the repo and from there i can use git diff to compare any two versions to see the differences between each

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
    
    version control enables experimentation because you know that you can reverse engineer the process and return back to a state at which the process worked

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
    
    i will continue working on becoming a more efficient version controller
