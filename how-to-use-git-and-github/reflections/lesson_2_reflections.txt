To make a new file, go into location with in the directory that you
want to access and choose the editor as well as the name and style

for instance: subl lesson_2_reflection.txt in the command line
created this file... all that was left to do was add content and 
save the contents so I could eventually push the contents to GitHub

git commit 
git log 

view history of commits:
git log gives id, author, message

git diff compares two versions of a file by looking at the id
example: git diff fasdfads431re adfasdf453124

diff compares two commits so it "operates on"
