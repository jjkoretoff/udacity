how to use the linux shell or a basic command lines

programmable, efficient

have to set up a virtual linux server - Linux virtual machine - VirtualBox with vagrant software

https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads

path for this project /Users/johnkoretoff/code/udacity/linux-command-line-basics/shell

from there, type "vagrant up" in the command line
then "vagrant ssh"

** everytime you access the path for this class (ending in /shell) .... retype vagrant ssh to access the Ubuntu VM through vagrant 

"exit" allows me to leave the shell

if vagrant ssh doesnt work... vagrant up then retry

terminal is an alternate interface 

terminal vs the shell: 
-terminal: output and input
-shell: knows what to do

unbuntu bash... etc

you can see an apostrophe in output if you put a backslash before it 
  example I\'m good \!



Common commands:
  ls = list files
  curl = download file from the web
  date = prints the current time and date
  expr 2 + 2 = yields a result of 4, calculator
  echo You rock = repeats You rock in output
    echo means print
  uname = tells us what operating system we are running
    uname -a gives more information
  hostname = prints vagrants VM's name 
  host udacity.com = tells us udacity.com hosts, ip ad.
  bash --version = version of bash shell we are running
  history = what we have done
  rm = deletes a file
    rm -r deletes a directory or folder
