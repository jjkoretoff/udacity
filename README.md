Udacity Courses

the protocol for my udacity courses is to, from this point forward, make a .txt file for each title section of a class

here is file path structure:
/Users/<user>/code/udacity/<class>/<files or folders>
you can see that each class might differ slightly and receive different paths after the <class> level
