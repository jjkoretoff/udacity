Udacity Courses

the protocol for my udacity courses is to, from this point forward, make a .txt file for each title section of a class

example : cs2.txt is lesson 2 of intro to cs

other categories and files will be introduced as needed

here is file path structure:
/Users/<user>/code/udacity/<class>/<files or folders>
you can see that each class might differ slightly and receive different paths after the <class> level
