Lesson 2 problem set
(table in google drive for 1 thru 6)
1. Blood types - 35 donations - frequency proportion, 
    and percentage. Sigma = sum

2. AB is the most rare blood type
3. O is the most common blood type
4. .37 is the proportion of Type A donors
5. Guesstimate of Type O population blood type = 46%
6. Analyze - guesstimate the .06 proportion  of population cannot donate blood to others
7. n = 7901
8. .03, 2.61, 50. 45 for the percentages
9. 1981-90 is the most common decade for Uacity users
10. Between 9 and 26% were born before 1975
11. The oldest person is at least 90.
12. Each bin is two years on the histogram
13. The most common bin is 1990 - 1992
14. Negatively skewed so most were born between 80 and 00
15. Categorical data is on the x-axis
16. THe height of each bar is a percentage
17. As of 2011, facebook has penetrated more of latin america than any other market
18. If data ranges from 15 to 105 and you want each bin to represent 10 numbers then you need 9 bins
19. A frequency table is better for calculating n
20. A histogram is better for identifying the shape of a data distribution
21. 60 minutes is the most frequent commute time
22. Approximately at least 40 people commute over 59 minutes
23. The bin width is 2
24. All employees commute over 20 minutes and most are 50-60 minutes
25. As we make the bin size bigger, the frequency gets larger
26. In a postive skew, scores with the lowest frequency distribution are on the right hand side. 
27. To understand student performance on an exam where the class was split even above and below 75 percent, we look at the final exam score distribution to understand student performance. 
28. a positive skew sees the median more to the left 
29. y-axis represents frequency
30. x-axis of a histogram should be numerical 
31. a positive skew has more observations on the left
32. a negative skew has more observations on the right and example of this could be a test where most students scored high as opposed to low
33. a normal distribution is often symmetrical with the bulk of the observations landing in the middle of a histogram. many things are normally distributed such as economic prices 
34. histograms are good for visualizing the shape of a distribution, frequency tables are good for calculating the total number in the sample/population, and you can alwasy create a histogram if you have a frequency table
