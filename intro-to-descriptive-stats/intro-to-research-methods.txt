Lesson 1

What would you do to prepare for an exam?
    %:
    28 - eat a good dinner
    42 - get a workout
    1 - other
    13 - good nights sleep
    16 - stay up studying

What information is necessary to know if survey is valid?
    #How many people?
    #Who was surveyed?
    #How was the survey conducted?

Make good decisions off of valid research

Analyze relationship between memory and grade
How would you measure memory?
    I would measaure mememory from both long and short term perspectives. I would track the amount of sleep that the subjects got and compare that against their results on the memory tests.

Defining constructs is not always straight-forward and there are many subjective ways that they can be measured. 

BBC Memory test: Recognition Score and Temporal Mem Score
    recog - faces seen before
    temp - when face seen

Sharing data through a google account

How did BBC measure memory?
    # The percent of faces correctly recognized and place from parts 1 and 2 of the test -- very exact

Operational definition in mind in order to run tests and measure real world constructs. 

Constructs:
    All of the items below are constructs:
        intelligence (IQ test)
        effort (minutes, grades, GPA)
        hunger (how often you want food)
        itchiness (scratch duration)
        age (not in years therefore it is a construct)

Constructs have operational definitions that allow us to measure.

Data
    Most essential part of statistics - without it, statistics do not exist. 

Memory Influencers
    time of day - BIG INFLUENCE
    breaks
    age - BIG INFLUENCE
    not paying attention
    stress

Data becomes more reliable with the more constants that appear in a test. Extraneous factors are "lurking" variables that influence the results of a test. 

Statistics
Within a population, not all averages of samples will be equal to the population.

Population parameter = mu
Population sample = x(bar)

Can use x(bar) to estimate mu
Difference between x(bar) and mu is the Sampling  error

Better samples = smaller sampling error = better results

Sample statistic can give us an inteval on which the population parameter lies

Random sampling is thus important

Visualizing data is an important attribute of data analysis
    x-axis = independent variable or predictor
    y-axis = dependent variable or the outcome
    *can correlate but not necessarily cause*

Correlation does not imply causation

**golden arches theory of conflict prevention**
    explanation: regulatory environment, westernization, etc

Causal Inference
show relationships = observational surveys
show causation = controlled experiment
    **course focused on this**

Surveys
    used in social and behavioral sciences
    benefits
        relatively inexpensive
        conduct remotely
        easy way to get population
        anyone can access

Surveys are prone to issues
    untruthful responses
    biased responses
    respondents not understanding the question
    respondents refusing to answer

Experiments
    test sleep medication
    random sample 
        some with active and some with active
            actual vs placebo
    why use placebo?
        creates a comparison group
        blind to see results so they arent skewed  
    double blind experiment
        researcher and participant dont know which treatment was received - can influence results
    sing blind experiment
        on;y participant doesnt know

Random Assignment
    everyone has an equal chance of being assignmen
    increases chance of control and experiment being =

Memory tests: two for one person
    lots of sleep
    little sleep 

    what is the control?
        looking for variation in memory capability

course focuses on observational studies

Hand length - how tall am I if my hand is 6.75 inches?
    guess: 65 inches
    conclusion - people with longer hands tend to be taller
