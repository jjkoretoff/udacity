  sigma sum | 

deviations = xi - xbar = average population - average sample

squared deviations = deviations ^ 2

sum of squares = sum of all squared deviations

variance population = sum of squares / n

variance sample = sum of squares / n-1

standard deviation = sigma = sqrt(variance)

Methodology = 
    take the average of the set called xi
    subtract each individual item xbar from xi
    square each individual item
    add each item together for sum of squares
    divide ss by n or n-1 to arive at variance sigma2
    square root the varianve to arrive at sd sigma
