Problem set for lesson one

1. Population is an entire set <mu>
2. Sample is a samller selction of a population<x(bar)>
3. Samples produce statistics
6. Parameters describe the population
7. Sampling error is the difference between mu and x(bar)
9. Random samples are more likely to represent the pop
10. Constructs do not have a specified unit of measurement
12. Operational definitions turn constructs into measurable variables and are used to desribe variables in terms of measurement. 
13. We expect samples to not fully reflect the population
14. Variables change and constants stay the same.
16. Hypotheses are subject to testing and not necessarily T
17. Extraneous (or lurking) variables must be considered
18. x(bar) is the sample avg, mu is the population avg
21. Random samples should broadly reflect pop
22. Random samples are less biased and rep pop
23. Questions concerning sampling and population
26. Contruct -> operational definition -> prediciton
33. In an experiment, the researcher manipulates the INDEPENDENT variable, measures changes in the DEPENDENT variable, and seeks to control the LURKING variables. 
36. Small sample can cause non-reponse bias, inaccurate responses which causes the sample to not be representative.
37. Experimental studies allow for causal conclusions
38. Sleep experiment: pill was independent and success was determined by separation between pill and placebo patients on 10 point scale
