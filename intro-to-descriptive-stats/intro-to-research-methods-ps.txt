Problem set for lesson one

1. Population is an entire set <mu>
2. Sample is a samller selction of a population<x(bar)>
3. Samples produce statistics
6. Parameters describe the population
7. Sampling error is the difference between mu and x(bar)
9. Random samples are more likely to represent the pop
10. Constructs do not have a specified unit of measurement
12. Operational definitions turn constructs into measurable variables and are used to desribe variables in terms of measurement. 
13. We expect samples to not fully reflect the population
14. Variables change and constants stay the same.
16. Hypotheses are subject to testing and not necessarily T
17. Extraneous (or lurking) variables must be considered
18. x(bar) is the sample avg, mu is the population avg
