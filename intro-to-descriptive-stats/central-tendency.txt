Lesson 3 

Which major should you chose based off of a histogram?
    nursing major distribution narrower & higher than geo
        nursing frequency is much higher than geo at mode

How do you choose a number that accurately represents a typical salry?
    highest frequency (mode), average (mean), and middle valuable (median) are all viable

The Mode
    the highest frequency value in a dataset
    the mode can be identified as a single number
    the mode can also be identified as a range of num

Negative Skew Distribution
    most observations are to the left of the mode

Uniform Distribution
    there is no mode if all values across the x-axis are equal

Multiple modes
    a data set can have two max frequencies
    example: shoe size for both male and female

The mode ALWAYS occurs on the x-axis and its frequencies are on the y-axis

Finding the Mean
    mean = xbar
    xbar = sum of values / number of observations

Procedure for finding the mean
    sum the variable and divide by the number of observations

Iterative Procedure
    above

Symbols
    sum = sigma
    variable being summed = x
    number of observations = n

    therefore, a sample procedure is
        xbar = sigma(x)/ n

    therefore, a population procedure is
        mu = sigma(x)/N

Properties of the mean
    all scores in the distribution affect the mean
    th emean can be described with a formula
    many samples from the same population will have similar means
    the mean of a sample can be used to make inferences about the population it came from
    the mean will change if we add an extreme value

Mean with an outlier
    can cause the mean to be extremly misleading 
    values that are unexpectedly different
    must observe relationship between mean and median

Median
    the middle of the data
    most easily found after the data is in order

Median with an outlier
    less movement will be caused by an outlier when compared to the mean
    when you have an even number of observations, the median lies exactly between the point above and the point below the median

The median is ROBUST
    not affected much by departures from the mode

Measures of the center
    mean, median, and mode
        all can be used and all have their strengths and weaknesses

Measure of center change
    positive skew: mode < median < mean
        highest frequency < middle < average
    normal distribution: mode = median = mean
    negative skew: mode > median > mean

    find the mean - 585
    find the median - sort - 479
        formula - 
            even x(n/2)+x(n/2 + 1) / 2
            odd x(n+1/2)

4. not affected by outliers - median & mode
5. easy to find on a histogram - mode
