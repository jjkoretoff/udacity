Lesson 2

Who takes udacity classes? 
    people from all over the world
    formalize the procedure

Frequency table
    count frequency table 

Relative frequency
    percent of observations for each variable in sample
    all oproportions are always between or equal to 0 and 1


    a frequency table should add to 1

Set intervals
    interval, bin, or bucket

Visualizing data
    graph creation
        bars, lines, scatterplots, histogram, etc
    x-axis, y-axis, origin

histogram = http://www.shodor.org/interactivate/activities/Histogram/

bins - how percise do you want to be
    interval in which you count the frequency
    sacrifice detail for conveinence 

Histogram vs Bar graph
    bar- separations show distinction, restricting, qual
    his- separation shows lack of observation, order matters all the time, quant

Histogram output observations
    symmetries, height, length, 
    normal distribution has one peak called a mode
    positive skew - more values on left than right
